Fair Coin Project: Crypto Earned Through Effort

This project comes with a different concept. We aim to create a system where everyone can mine coins through their own effort. Unlike meme coins that are printed and distributed without any real effort, coins in this project can only be obtained through active and ongoing mining.

Key Features:

10 Trillion Limited Coins: A total coin supply that will run out in five years.

Easy and Fair Mining: The mining process is simple and based on tapping the screen. The more active you are, the more coins you earn.

No Fake Coin Printing: Every coin earned through mining is a result of real effort. No coin printing without work.

Transparency and Security: Once mining is underway, the project will connect to blockchain to ensure transaction transparency and security.

Fair Rewards: Coins gradually decrease over time without halving or unfair coin distribution systems.


We believe that crypto should be fair and accessible to everyone. So, are you ready to mine and join a truly fair community? Start today and mine your coins now!
